📊 UPI Transaction Analysis – PhonePe Data


📌 Project Overview

This project presents an in-depth analysis of UPI transaction data from PhonePe, focusing on financial insights, spending patterns, and digital payment behavior.
Using Power BI, I transformed raw transaction records into an interactive dashboard that answers key questions such as:

Where am I spending the most?

How do my expenses vary by category and time?

What are my inflows vs outflows trends?

The analysis not only highlights personal finance tracking but also demonstrates data analytics skills that can be applied in domains like digital payments, banking, and fintech.
